## Milestone 1 Feedback 
This looks great. Nice work here. Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all well done. Your project is set up correctly, and your HTML looks good. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- make sure your .gitignore is committed and pushed to GitHub. I see your .gitignore file on the server, and it's perfectly fine. But I don't see it on GitHub.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Excellent work here. Your site map, content strategy, and interaction flow are all well done and cohesive with your overall purpose and goals for your project. 

Your wireframes are very well done, and will provide you with a solid guide as you begin your development phase. Plan to include an HTML contact form on your contact page. This will be PHP driven using Swiftmailer.

Technically your project is in excellent shape, and your code looks great. Your milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP.
