## Milestone 1 Feedback 
This looks great. Nice work here. Your purpose, audience, goal, persona and use case are all well done. Your project is set up correctly, and your HTML looks good. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- make sure your .gitignore is committed and pushed to GitHub. I see your .gitignore file on the server, and it's perfectly fine. But I don't see it on GitHub.
